# 2-Factor-Authentication-using-Email

2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are.  
First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information, which in our case is a One Time Password that you receive on yuor registered E-mail everytime you Log-in.
